# Abstract

In the era of smart phones, mobile application development has become one of the leading fields in business and keeping the users engaged along with forecast- ing their future behavior are one of the main challenges in this field. This project focuses on mobile application users’ segmentation and churn prediction based on 95.000 users’ app usage data. The methods used to segment the users vary from marketing techniques as RFM analysis to Gaussian Mixture Models. Consider- ing that knowing whether the user deleted the application or not is impossible to retrieve, a definition of user churn is suggested and used to label the data. Fi- nally, binary classification models are built for the labeled data in order to predict customer churn.
